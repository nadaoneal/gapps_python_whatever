I'll be pushing up scripts that we use for our EDU "Google Apps for your Domain" domain.
Mostly, these are calendar and contacts scripts. 

I was motivated to do this because I think the documentation for the domain-wide functions,
especially for the python api, is not all that great. So the scripts I'm sharing are ALSO not all 
that great, but I'm hoping that you'll find them useful as you harvest them for specific 
syntax examples.

** backup.py **
Backs up the domain-wide contact list, sets a temporary bypass htpasswd password in order to back up 
every user's calendars via http. (to avoid API limits) Should be using oauth for the authentication 
instead; has other messy bits.

The rest of the scripts have to do with a local "fund codes" application. 
The application is written up here: http://hdl.handle.net/10022/AC:P:9978

** fundcodes.py **
 * accessing user-created calendar feeds to create events in non-default calendars
 * creating domain-wide contacts
 * sharing user-created calendars with the domain

Solves a specific situation - moves expenditure data for electonic resource renewals, currently stored in 
text exports on a server to which I have limited access, into Google Calendar, and provides 3- and 5-month 
reminders for next year's renewal. The expenditure data is updated biweekly, but put into cumulative files. 
Each fund code is in its own directory. Each fund code needs its own calendar.

This script makes calendars under an admin account, shares those calendars with the domain, then adds 
them to the domain-wide addressbook. Then, for each "Fund Code" calendar, looks to see if there's any
data for it; if so, adds any new events.

** fundcodes_abook_cleanup.py **
 * deleting domain-wide addresses
 * domain-wide contacts query

Ahem. Needed to clean up some extraneous addr book entries after some false starts with fundcodes.py. 

** emptycals.py **

Empties all events from calendars whose titles are in a set you create, or that match a regex.
This script is fairly old/messy; written while I was still very green.

** listsub.py **

Lists everyone who has subscribed to a "fund codes" calendar, and emails the list to interested parties.
