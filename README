I'll be pushing up scripts that we use for our EDU "Google Apps for your Domain" domain.
Mostly, these are calendar and contacts scripts. 

I was motivated to do this because I think the documentation for the domain-wide functions,
especially for the python api, is not all that great. So the scripts I'm sharing are ALSO not all 
that great, but I'm hoping that you'll find them useful as you harvest them for specific 
syntax examples.

See each script file for more info on each, but I'll summarize below.

This is the first time I've ever used python, so if you see weird, non-python decisions happening, 
it's not you, it's me.

** fundcodes.py **
 * accessing user-created calendar feeds to create events in non-default calendars
 * creating domain-wide contacts
 * sharing user-created calendars with the domain

Solves a really silly situation - someone wanted expenditure data, which is currently produced by a 
closed-source vendor application in a silly way, and stored in a silly place, to be put into Google
Calendar. The expenditure data is updated biweekly, but put into cumulative files. Each code is in its
own directory. Each code needs its own calendar.

This script makes calendars under an admin account, shares those calendars with the domain, then adds 
them to the domain-wide addressbook. Then, for each "Fund Code" calendar, looks to see if there's any
data for it; if so, adds any new events.

** backup.py **
(Coming soon)
